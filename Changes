	* lib/Haver/Server/Channel.pm, lib/Haver/Server/Connection.pm,
	lib/Haver/Server/User.pm: Made the client's output more JRC-like.

	* lib/Haver/Server/Connection.pm, lib/Haver/Server/User.pm: Server
	now sends PINGs and expects PONGs, about every two minutes. There
	might be bugs, though.

	I reorganized accept and reject code into two different events of
	the same names.

	I also made it illegal (REJECT-able, that is) for the client to
	just send 'UID'.

	* Makefile.PL, bin/haverd.pl: We're re-organizing the directory
	structure, so it is more modular.
