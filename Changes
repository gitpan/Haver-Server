	lib/Haver/Server/Commands.pm, lib/Haver/Server/Connection.pm:
	Getting ready to release 0.04 "Vinegar"!

2004-02-21  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	lib/Haver/Server/Listener.pm, lib/Haver/Server/Object.pm,
	lib/Haver/Server/Registry.pm, lib/Haver/Server/User.pm: Lots of new
	changes... passwords work now. Split off cmd_* stuff into
	Commands.pm

2004-02-21  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* lib/Haver/Server/Object/Container.pm: foo.

2004-02-21  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* Makefile.PL, bin/haverd.pl, lib/Haver/Server.pm,
	lib/Haver/Server/Channel.pm, lib/Haver/Server/Connection.pm,
	lib/Haver/Server/Listener.pm, lib/Haver/Server/Object.pm,

	wrapper.

2004-02-19  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* .cvsignore: Added Changes to various .cvsignore files.

2004-02-19  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* MANIFEST, bin/haverd.pl, lib/Haver/Server/Channel.pm,
	lib/Haver/Server/Connection.pm, lib/Haver/Server/Object.pm,
	lib/Haver/Server/User.pm: Removed Changes files. They should have
	never been in CVS.  Also made various changes. Probably I broke
	something, but I'm too tired to test... CVS verions of things are
	supposed to be broken anyway. ;)

2004-02-17  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* lib/Haver/Server.pm: nothing important.

2004-02-17  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* bin/haverd.pl, lib/Haver/Server/Connection.pm: PING support is
	now missing.  But QUIT now exists.

2004-02-16  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* lib/Haver/Server/Channel.pm, lib/Haver/Server/Connection.pm,
	lib/Haver/Server/User.pm: Made the client's output more JRC-like.

2004-02-16  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* lib/Haver/Server/Connection.pm, lib/Haver/Server/User.pm: Server
	now sends PINGs and expects PONGs, about every two minutes. There
	might be bugs, though.
	
	I reorganized accept and reject code into two different events of
	the same names.
	
	I also made it illegal (REJECT-able, that is) for the client to
	just send 'UID'.

2004-02-16  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore files.

	files.

2004-02-15  dylanwh <dylanwh@tampabay.rr.com>

	* Makefile.PL, bin/haverd.pl: We're re-organizing the directory
	structure, so it is more modular.
